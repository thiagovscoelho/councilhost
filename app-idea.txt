Council.host

Convene • Propose • Opine • Amend • Resolve

Council.host is a webapp idea I just had.

Convene: The app is, initially, targeted to users of X (formerly Twitter). You write out a list of X usernames who are allowed in the council, and then you send these users the council link, and the ones who accept the invitation become council members. A council is convened on a specific council issue, which is provided by the convener. After sufficient discussion has been had to propose a series of conclusions and opine on them, the council may resolve and publish a joint statement.

Propose: The main screen of the app is a “List of proposed conclusions” to which any user may add by making a “Proposal”, which adds a conclusion to the list of conclusions. A proposal is simply a text field.

Opine: After a conclusion is in the list of conclusions, users may Opine on a conclusion. Clicking the Opine button on a conclusion gives you the Opine form, which is a radio button for Support/Oppose and a text field for Reasoning.

Amend: In lieu of an Edit function, any user may propose an Amendment to any conclusion. This is effectively a different conclusion, but if it is at least equally as or more popular than the original (more Support vs Oppose) then it replaces it instead of being added alongside it.

Resolve: Any user may propose a “Move To Resolve”, which, if it reaches unanimous support, a council is resolved. In a standard resolution, the council publishes a joint statement, signed under their X usernames. It follows a formula: “From [council start date/time] to [council end date/time], we, the X users [usernames] convened a council on the issue: [council issue]. We have resolved, unanimously, on the following conclusions: [unanimous conclusions]. A majority also resolved on the following conclusions: [majoritarian conclusions]. The minority adds their dissent: [reasoning from Oppose actions to the majoritarian conclusions, attributed to each user who opposed].” Alternatively, a user may propose a “Move To Close Without Resolving” which instead creates a statement: “From [council start date/time] to [council end date/time], the X users [usernames] convened a council on the issue: [council issue]. The council was closed without resolving upon any conclusions.”
